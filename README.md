# CuttingTool
Image Processing tool to obtain quickly ROI coordinates 

Initally developed this tool o obtain the 4 cordinates (square or rectangle) for the different ROIs that I need for a different project, so baically generates a .json file with the coordinates agrupated with a customizable name that is created when the ROI is selected in the canvas of the UI.

Only need to open the picture desired and start drawing the ROIs on the canvas adding the desired name.
